# Trivial README update for demo purposes

# Qodo Merge Demo

This repository demonstrates a large, noisy PR for first-pass review using Qodo Merge. The PR adds a new `/multiply` endpoint, refactors code, updates documentation, and includes unit tests. Many files have trivial edits to simulate real-world review complexity.

## Endpoints
- `/multiply`: Multiplies two numbers. (POST)

## Running

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

## Testing

```sh
pytest
```

## Storyline
This PR is intentionally large and noisy, with many trivial changes and a few meaningful ones. Qodo Merge will:
- Summarize the PR
- Auto-generate a PR description
- Suggest inline improvements (e.g., flag inefficient code)
