# Qodo Merge Demo - PR #1: Speed

This repository demonstrates a large, noisy PR for first-pass review using Qodo Merge. This PR adds a new `/search` endpoint, refactors code, updates documentation, and includes unit tests. Many files have trivial edits to simulate real-world review complexity.

## 🚀 What's New in This PR

### New Features
- **Search Endpoint**: New `/search` and `/search/simple` endpoints for querying data
- **Enhanced Models**: Added `SearchRequest`, `SearchResponse`, and other data models
- **Utility Functions**: New helper functions for search, formatting, validation, and caching
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized configuration with environment variable support
- **Middleware**: Request logging, timing, and validation middleware
- **Database Layer**: SQLite integration with search logging and API usage tracking
- **Custom Exceptions**: Comprehensive error handling with detailed error codes
- **Validation System**: Input validation for various data types and formats
- **Constants**: Application-wide constants for configuration and validation

### Enhanced Endpoints
- **POST /search**: Full-featured search with filters and pagination
- **GET /search/simple**: Quick search for simple queries
- **GET /stats**: Application statistics and metrics
- **Enhanced /health**: Improved health check with timestamp
- **Enhanced /multiply**: Better documentation and error handling

## 🎯 Demo Goals

This PR is intentionally large and noisy, with many trivial changes and a few meaningful ones. Qodo Merge will demonstrate:

1. **AI Summary**: Generate a focused, trustworthy summary of the changes
2. **Auto PR Description**: Create a comprehensive PR description automatically
3. **Inline Suggestions**: Flag inefficient code (e.g., the multiplication loop) and suggest improvements
4. **Large PR Handling**: Show how to efficiently review 20+ files with 500+ lines of changes

## 🔍 Key Changes

### Core Functionality
- **Search System**: Complete search implementation with request/response models
- **Database Integration**: SQLite database with search logging and metrics
- **Middleware Stack**: Request logging, timing, and validation
- **Configuration**: Environment-based configuration management

### Code Quality Improvements
- **Type Hints**: Comprehensive type annotations throughout
- **Error Handling**: Custom exceptions with detailed error information
- **Validation**: Input validation for all endpoints
- **Documentation**: Extensive docstrings and comments

### Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage for new functionality
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end testing scenarios
- **Mock Data**: Test data generation utilities

## 🚨 Intentionally Included Issues

For demo purposes, this PR includes some code quality issues that Qodo Merge should flag:

1. **Inefficient Multiplication**: The `/multiply` endpoint uses nested loops instead of simple multiplication
2. **Duplicate Code**: Some utility functions have similar patterns that could be refactored
3. **Hardcoded Values**: Some constants could be moved to configuration
4. **Missing Error Handling**: Some edge cases lack proper error handling

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Demo

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip

### Installation
